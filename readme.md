# üéß Telegram Music Streaming App

This project is a **music streaming platform** that fetches music content (albums and tracks) from a **public Telegram channel** and serves it through a **Spring Boot backend API** to a **web or mobile frontend**.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: LEGAL AND COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**This project explores the technical feasibility of sourcing content from a Telegram channel. However, streaming, distributing, or otherwise using copyrighted music without explicit permission and appropriate licenses from copyright holders is illegal in most jurisdictions.**

**Before proceeding with, developing, or deploying any part of this project that involves copyrighted material, you MUST:**

1.  **Ensure you have the full legal rights and necessary licenses** to use, reproduce, and publicly perform/distribute every piece of music.
2.  **Consult with a legal professional** specializing in intellectual property and copyright law to understand your obligations and potential liabilities.

**Relying on content being "publicly available" on Telegram does NOT automatically grant you the rights to use it in a separate application. The developers and contributors of this conceptual project outline do not endorse or encourage any illegal activity, and you are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws.**

## üìå Project Overview

- **Source**: Music is published in a public Telegram channel.
- **Crawler**: A Node.js service (using `gram-js`) scrapes music data and stores metadata in a shared database.
- **Backend**: A Spring Boot API serves track metadata and streams music files (either from Telegram or from local cache).
- **Frontend**: (Not included in this repo) A React or Flutter app that connects to the backend and plays the music.

```

The system is designed with a multi-tiered architecture:

1.  **Telegram Channel (Content Source):** The public Telegram channel where music albums (audio files, cover art, descriptions) are published.
2.  **Backend Service/Worker (Content Ingestion & Processing):**
    * Regularly polls the Telegram channel for new messages using the Telegram API.
    * Parses messages to extract audio files, album art, and metadata.
    * (Recommended) Downloads media to dedicated cloud storage for reliability and performance.
    * Populates the central database with music metadata.
3.  **Database (Metadata & User Store):**
    * Stores metadata for albums, tracks, artists, genres.
    * Stores user information (profiles, playlists, favorites).
    * *This database is shared by the Backend Service/Worker and the API Server.*
4.  **API Server (Backend Logic):**
    * Exposes RESTful or GraphQL APIs for the mobile application.
    * Handles user authentication and authorization.
    * Provides endpoints for fetching music data, search, playlist management, etc.
    * Serves audio stream information (links to cloud storage or direct streams).
5.  **Cloud Storage (Recommended):**
    * Hosts audio files and images (album art) for reliable and efficient delivery.
    * Can be fronted by a CDN for improved performance.
6.  **Mobile App (Frontend):**
    * User interface for Browse, searching, and playing music.
    * Features include music player controls, playlist management, user accounts, and potentially offline downloads.

## Project Setup & Installation

**(Details to be added once development begins)**

This section will include steps on:
* Cloning the repository.
* Setting up the backend environment (Telegram API credentials, database connection, cloud storage configuration).
* Building and running the API server.
* Building and running the mobile application.
* Configuration of the Telegram channel (e.g., message format conventions).

---

## üì¶ Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Database

Use PostgreSQL or MongoDB and create a schema called `musicapp`.

### 2. Run Telegram Crawler

```bash
cd telegram-crawler
npm install
node index.js
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You'll need a Telegram API ID, hash, and phone login.

### 3. Run Spring Boot API

```bash
cd music-api-springboot
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Make sure the DB config in `application.yml` matches your setup.

## üìÅ Future Improvements

* Caching Telegram audio locally or to cloud (S3)
* Frontend player with search, albums, and playlists
* Admin panel to curate data
* Integration tests and CI/CD pipeline

---

## Usage

**(Details to be added once the application is functional)**

This section will describe how to use the application, both from an end-user perspective and potentially for administrators (if an admin panel is developed).
